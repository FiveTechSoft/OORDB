 ! TField : Send 'value' parameter to ON VALUE clause, and disable setting ::buffer ( to allow use field:Value )
   and leave it in the form ON VALIDATE {|Self,value| check( value ) }
   current behavior is incorrect because field:Value is not yet phisically assigned to the table
   alse the field:Change value is not correctly setted yet because it occurs later on field:WriteToTable

 ! TField : don't use NEWVALUE as DEFAULTVALUE

 % TIndex : Create procedure to update custom indexes defined on descedant classes even when fields involved
   are updated on base classes (a external index table to read on DEFINE INDEX ? )

 ! Check for duplicated index name (tag name and class name)
